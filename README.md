# Getting-Started-With-DevOps---Git

Git and GitHub are essential tools in getting started with DevOps.

 - Git is a Version Control System (VCS) that manages project files.
 - GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories

Git keeps track of the entire history of project, managing the code, enabling collaborators to contribute to a shared GitHub repository.

The aim is to incrementally learn:

 - basic Git features for the first (basic) build of a project
 - moving onto Git (branching and merging) features when improving the project functionality by adding new features
